# Temporal & Scenario Analysis - Quick Reference Card

## At a Glance

**What is this?**
A tool for temporal evolution analysis and scenario exploration of constellation graphs.

**What it's NOT:**
Version control (Git), undo/redo, or collaborative editing.

**Key Idea:**
Capture snapshots of your graph at different times or scenarios, then compare and analyze them.

## Core Concepts (5-Second Summary)

| Concept | What It Is | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **State** | Snapshot of graph at specific moment | "Q1 2023", "Session 5", "Strategy A" |
| **Timeline** | Ordered sequence of states | Jan ‚Üí Feb ‚Üí Mar ‚Üí Apr |
| **Scenario** | Alternative branch from a point | Current ‚Üí Strategy A vs Strategy B |
| **Comparison** | Visual diff between two states | What changed from Q1 to Q4? |
| **Journey** | Track one actor across states | How did Alice's role evolve? |

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Historical Tracking
Track how your network changed over time

- **Cons**: Can be cluttered with many changes

### Diff List
Text list of all changes
- **Best for**: Systematic review
- **Pros**: Comprehensive, exportable
- **Cons**: Less visual

## Best Practices

### Naming States
‚úÖ **Good**: "Q3 2023: Post-Merger Integration"
‚ùå **Bad**: "State 3"

‚úÖ **Good**: "Session 5: Breakthrough Session"
‚ùå **Bad**: "May 15"

‚úÖ **Good**: "Strategy A: Aggressive Growth (Optimistic)"
‚ùå **Bad**: "Option 1"

### When to Capture States
‚úÖ Capture at **significant milestones**
‚úÖ Capture at **regular intervals** (quarterly, sessions)
‚úÖ Capture **before major changes**

‚ùå Don't capture for every tiny edit
‚ùå Don't create states "just in case"
‚ùå Don't capture without context/labels

### Organizing States
‚úÖ **Use timelines** for temporal sequences
‚úÖ **Use scenarios** for alternatives
‚úÖ **Add descriptions** explaining what changed
‚úÖ **Tag states** for easy finding

‚ùå Don't mix temporal and scenario in same timeline
‚ùå Don't create orphaned states without context
‚ùå Don't forget to clean up old/unused states

## Common Workflows

### Workflow: Temporal Analysis
```
1. Start with current graph
2. Capture state: "Jan 2024"
3. Make changes to graph
4. Capture state: "Feb 2024"
5. Repeat monthly
6. View timeline
7. Compare Jan vs Dec
8. Animate evolution
```

### Workflow: Scenario Exploration
```
1. Create current state: "Current Reality"
2. Branch scenario: "Strategy A"
3. Modify graph for Strategy A
4. Capture: "Strategy A - Year 1"
5. Return to "Current Reality"
6. Branch scenario: "Strategy B"
7. Develop Strategy B
8. Compare Strategy A vs B
```

### Workflow: Actor Journey
```
1. Ensure multiple states captured
2. Select actor on graph
3. Click "View Journey" (right panel)
4. See actor's timeline
5. Review changes over time
6. Export journey report
```

  snapshot: { nodes, edges },
  temporal: { label, timestamp },
  // OR
  scenario: { label, description, assumptions },
  notes: "What changed and why"
}
```

### Timeline

## Performance Tips

### For Large Graphs (100+ actors)
- Capture states selectively
- Use state pagination
- Enable caching
- Reduce animation quality if needed

### For Many States (50+ states)
- Organize into multiple timelines
- Use semantic search (ChromaDB)
- Archive old states
- Export/backup regularly

### For Smooth Animation
- Limit number of frames
- Use simplified rendering
- Adjust animation speed
- Close other applications

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: State won't load
**Solution**: Check if state data is corrupted, try restarting app

### Problem: Comparison is slow
**Solution**: Large graph - reduce comparison mode quality or use diff list

### Problem: Animation is choppy
**Solution**: Reduce animation speed or quality setting

### Problem: Can't find a state
**Solution**: Use search function or check timeline filters

### Problem: Timeline is cluttered
**Solution**: Create multiple timelines, archive old states

## FAQs

**Q: Will this replace normal editing?**
A: No, it's optional. You can ignore states and use app normally.

**Q: Can I undo after capturing a state?**
A: Yes, undo/redo is separate. States don't affect edit history.

**Q: How many states can I create?**
A: No hard limit, but recommend <100 per document for performance.

**Q: Can I delete a state?**
A: Yes, but be careful - this can't be undone.

**Q: Can I rename states?**
A: Yes, edit state metadata anytime.

**Q: Can states be shared?**
A: Yes, they're included in document export/import.

**Q: What's the difference between temporal and scenario?**
A: Temporal = time progression. Scenario = alternative branches.

**Q: Can I merge scenarios?**
A: No, scenarios are independent explorations for comparison.

## Quick Tips

üí° **Tip 1**: Label states descriptively - your future self will thank you

üí° **Tip 2**: Use comparison view liberally - it's the most powerful feature

üí° **Tip 3**: Animate timelines for presentations - it's impressive!

üí° **Tip 4**: Track key actors across states to tell their story

üí° **Tip 5**: Capture states BEFORE making major changes (safety net)

üí° **Tip 6**: Use scenarios to explore "what if" without commitment

üí° **Tip 7**: Export comparison reports for documentation

üí° **Tip 8**: Clean up old/unused states periodically

---

## Remember

This is about **storytelling and analysis**, not version control!

Think: "How did this network evolve?" not "What edits did I make?"

Use states to:
- ‚úÖ Show temporal evolution
- ‚úÖ Explore scenarios
- ‚úÖ Compare alternatives
- ‚úÖ Track actor journeys
- ‚úÖ Present findings

Not to:
- ‚ùå Undo/redo edits
- ‚ùå Track every change
- ‚ùå Collaborate on editing
- ‚ùå Version control your work

**Happy analyzing!** üéâ
